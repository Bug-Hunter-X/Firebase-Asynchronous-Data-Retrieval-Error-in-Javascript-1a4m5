The following code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error in Firebase related to data retrieval and asynchronous operations.  The issue lies in accessing the data from a Firebase query before the query has completed.

```javascript
const db = firebase.firestore();

db.collection('users').where('age', '>', 25).get().then((querySnapshot) => {
  querySnapshot.forEach((doc) => {
    console.log(doc.data().name); //This might throw an error
  });
}).catch((error) => {
  console.log('Error getting documents: ', error);
});
```

This code attempts to access `doc.data().name` immediately after the query.  However, the asynchronous nature of Firebase means the data might not yet be loaded when this line executes, leading to a `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'name')` or similar errors. This is especially problematic if you're handling the data within a loop.  The error is less likely when you have only a few documents, but the probability increases with more documents.

Another less common scenario is when your security rules in Firebase Firestore are too permissive. A poorly configured security rule might unintentionally allow read access to data that the user shouldn't have access to, leading to unexpected results or data corruption if the user tries to access restricted data.
