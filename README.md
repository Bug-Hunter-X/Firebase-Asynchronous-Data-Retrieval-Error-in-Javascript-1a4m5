# Firebase Asynchronous Data Retrieval Error

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error that can occur when working with Firebase's asynchronous data retrieval methods, specifically when accessing data before the query has fully completed.

## The Problem

The problem stems from the asynchronous nature of Firebase database operations.  If you attempt to access data directly after initiating a query, there's a risk the data might not have been fetched yet, leading to errors like `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'name')`.

## Solution

The solution involves using promises and `.then()` to handle the asynchronous nature of the operation, ensuring you access data only after it has been successfully retrieved.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up a Firebase project and configure the necessary credentials.
3. Run the `bug.js` file.  Observe the error.
4. Run the `bugSolution.js` file.  Observe the correct output.
